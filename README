oct - the OMAP clock tool

USAGE
	Print clock rates with respect to a specific clock
		oct [--version] [--directory[=DEBUGFS_PATH]]
		[--output[=FILE_NAME]] [--format[=FORMAT_TYPE]]
		[--delimiter[=DELIMITER_STRING]]
		[--parent] [--help] CLOCK_NAME

	Print clock rates from the whole clock tree
		oct [--version] [--directory[=DEBUGFS_PATH]]
		[--output[=FILE_NAME]] [--format[=FORMAT_TYPE]]
		[--delimiter[=DELIMITER_STRING]]
		[--help] --tree

	Write a clock rate to a specific clock
		oct [--version] [--directory[=DEBUGFS_PATH]]
		    [--help] CLOCK_NAME CLOCK_RATE

	Switch a clock's parent to a new clock
		oct [--version] [--directory[=DEBUGFS_PATH]]
		    [--help] CLOCK_NAME PARENT_NAME

OPTIONS
	If two arguments are specified to omap-clock-tool then all output
	options are ignored.

	-d --directory	debugfs directory, default is /debug
	-h --help	print explanation of options and usage
	-o --output	output file, default is STDOUT
	-t --tree	print the whole clock tree
	-f --format	output in specific format.  Accepted formats are,
		=xml	XML format
		=dot	Graphiz DOT format
		=pair	clock name and clock speed separated by delimiter
	-l --delimiter	delimiter to use for 'pair' format, default is tab
	-p --parent	print data for the specified clock and it's parents
	-v --version	print version, copyright and author info

DESCRIPTION
	oct works by parsing the OMAP clock tree in debugfs via a depth-first
	search.  Once it finds the clock specified in the first argument then
	it will print the relevant clock rate information, or oct will set the
	new rate for that clock if a rate was specified.
	
	Depending on other options it is also possible to print the rates for
	all of the parent clocks up until the root clock, or even to print
	rate data for every clock in the system with the --tree option.

	By specifying two clock names and no rates oct can also be used to
	switch the parent clock of a specified clock.
	
	Any time that kernel operations fail will result in oct returning the
	value of the last debugfs operation.  If clock names are invalid oct
	will return -ENOENT. If parent/child clocks are not compatible then
	oct will return -EINVAL.  If the clock rate is not writeable oct will
	return -EPERM.  All failures result in verbose error messages sent to
	STDERR.

NOTES
	oct was only written with OMAP systems in mind.  Use on any processor
	other than an OMAP processor is pointless.  In fact oct might beat you
	up, steal your lover and render your device useless.

	oct was originally written in parallel to a Linux kernel patch
	enabling writable clock rates in debugfs for OMAP.  Without this patch
	your OMAP system will not be able to change clock rates and all
	operations will result in -EPERM return codes.
	
	Kernels prior to 2.6.26 will need to backport this patch.  It can be
	found at http://blahblahblah
